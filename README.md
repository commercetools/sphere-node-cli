## Features
- import of `stock`, `product`, `price`, `category`, `discount`, `order`, `customer`, `productType`, `discountCode`, `state`, `customObject`
- Docker support
- Custom plugin

## Requirements
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
  * Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). MacOS and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
  * Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. Make sure to get the latest active LTS version. You could also use a Node.js version manager such as [n](https://github.com/tj/n) or [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

> If you were using the [old ruby CLI](https://github.com/sphereio/sphere-cli) make sure to uninstall it first.

## Usage

```bash
$ npm install -g sphere-node-cli

# show general help
$ sphere -h

# show help for a command (e.g.: import)
$ sphere help <cmd>

```
The CLI is **still under development** but already provides a bunch of commands.<br/>
The idea behind it is to operate as a _proxy_ for the different libraries that are used underneath. For example the `import` command will stream chunks from a given JSON file and pass them to the related library that will handled the rest.


## Credentials

The CLI has a lookup mechanism to load SPHERE.IO project credentials.<br/>
If you specify a `-p, --project` option, the CLI will try to load the credentials for that project from the following locations:

```
./.sphere-project-credentials
./.sphere-project-credentials.json
~/.sphere-project-credentials
~/.sphere-project-credentials.json
/etc/sphere-project-credentials
/etc/sphere-project-credentials.json
```

There are 2 supported formats: `csv` and `json`.

- **csv**: `project_key:client_id:client_secret`
- **json**: `{ "project_key": { "client_id": "", "client_secret": "" } }`

If no `-p, --project` option is provided, the CLI tries to read the credentials from ENV variables:

```
export SPHERE_PROJECT_KEY=""
export SPHERE_CLIENT_ID=""
export SPHERE_CLIENT_SECRET=""
```

## Docker

[![Docker build](http://dockeri.co/image/sphereio/sphere-node-cli)](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/sphereio/sphere-node-cli/)

You need to have a working docker client! The [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/toolbox) is an installer to quickly and easily install and setup a Docker environment on your computer. Available for both Windows and Mac, the Toolbox installs Docker Client, Machine, Compose, Kitematic and VirtualBox.

### Examples

Show help
```bash
docker run \
sphereio/sphere-node-cli -h
```

Import a product (host folder `/sample_dir/` mounted as docker volume)
```bash
docker run \
-e SPHERE_PROJECT_KEY=<KEY>
-e SPHERE_CLIENT_ID=<ID>
-e SPHERE_CLIENT_SECRET=<SECRET>
-v /sample_dir/:/sample_dir/ \
sphereio/sphere-node-cli
import -p my-project-key -t product -f /sample_dir/products.json'
```

You can also set an alias for repeated calls:

```bash
alias sphere='docker run \
-v /etc/sphere-project-credentials.json:/etc/sphere-project-credentials.json \
sphereio/sphere-node-cli'
```

## Commands

The CLI has _git-like_ sub-commands which can be invoked as `sphere <cmd>`.

Current available commands:

- **import** (`stock`, `product`, `price`, `category`, `discount`, `order`, `customer`, `productType`, `discountCode`, `state`, `customObject`)

Commands expects at least a `-t, --type` option which may vary for each command.

#### `sphere-import`

Imports a resource `type` by streaming the input JSON file.

```bash
$ sphere import -p my-project-key -t product \
  -f sample_dir/products.json \
  -c '{"errorDir": "./productErrors"}'
```

The input must be a valid JSON following a specific schema (`import-type-key` is the _plural_ form of the `type` option, e.g.: `products`, `stocks`, etc.).

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  "title": "SPHERE.IO CLI import schema",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "<import-type-key>": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "$ref": "https://github.com/sphereio/sphere-json-schemas/tree/master/schema"
      }
    }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "required": ["<import-type-key>"]
}
```

> If you don't provide a file to read _from_, the CLI listens from `stdin` so you can i.e. pipe in something.


Each import type might have / expect some extra specific configuration. In that case you have to refer to the related documentation.
